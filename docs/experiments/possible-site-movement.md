# Possible site movement

Gitbook is great and all as it allows for free hosting, however their are alot of limitations of the websites able to be made using GitBook, and must tradiditional wikis don't use it as it is also not very optimized, so I am currently looking into other possible solutions. This is in very early beta stages and nothing has been confirmed yet, if I do decide to switch sites rest assured that all content on GitBook will be safety migrated to the new site. If you have any ideas or suggestions please let me know as they are very welcome and it is your suggestions and ideas not mine that make up this cummunity.
