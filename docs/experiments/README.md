# Experiments

This set of documentation is only usefully for developers of the Mathwiki and for people who are looking for content that they cant find in the main documentation, content found in here should not be relied on as it is EXPERIMENTAL. I would advise sticking to the main documentation.

I am not much of a developer and this is confusing for me if their is anywhere able and willing to help me out with this that would be great, contact me on the GitHub and we can find a better way to communicate from their.
