Skip to computer logic: [Computer logic](computer-logic.md)

Computer science, data science, computer logic, and coding all require some math skills so let's see where we can apply our math skills in these fields to help us understand them and get better at them.

#### Binary Logarithms in Computer Science

In computer science, [binary logarithms](../../functions/function-catalog/logarithmic-function/binary-logarithm.md) (log base 2) are crucial for understanding data structures, algorithms, and information theory. The binary logarithm of a number is the power to which the base 2 must be raised to obtain that number. Mathematically, for a number `N`, the binary logarithm is expressed as:

$$
\log_2N = x \implies 2^x = N
$$

**Relation to Information**

The binary logarithm helps quantify information in terms of bits. Claude Shannon's information theory defines the amount of information gained from an event as inversely proportional to its probability and expressed in bits using the binary logarithm:

$$
\text{Information} = -\log_2(\text{Probability})
$$

This formulation is essential in data compression and transmission, allowing us to determine the minimum number of bits required to encode data.

**Relation to Electrons**

In digital circuits, binary logic levels (0 and 1) represent low and high voltage states, controlled by the flow of electrons. Binary operations performed by these circuits are foundational to processing binary logarithms. Understanding binary transformations in electric signals helps optimize circuit design, enhance data processing efficiency, and bolster computational performance.
