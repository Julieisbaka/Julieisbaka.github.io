# Central Limit Theory

The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) states that the distribution of the sample means approximates a normal distribution as the sample size becomes large, regardless of the distribution shape of the population. This is a fundamental principle in statistics because it allows for the application of normal distribution properties to inferential statistics, simplifying many statistical procedures even when the population itself is not normally distributed.

To explain further, the Central Limit Theorem is crucial because it provides a way to make predictions about population parameters using sample data. When a sufficiently large sample size is chosen, the mean of these samples will tend to follow a normal distribution. This means that statisticians can use techniques designed for normal distributions, such as confidence intervals and hypothesis tests, even if the underlying data does not follow a normal distribution. The "largeness" of the sample size typically varies depending on the population, but a sample size of 30 is often considered adequate for the CLT to hold.
