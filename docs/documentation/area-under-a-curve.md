# Area under a curve

### Riemann sums

By splitting a curve into smaller rectangles and then adding up the sum of the area of the rectangles you are able to approximate the area under the curve. This accuracy of this method increases as you use more rectangles. To get a better approximation you can split the curve from the left and the right; then take the average of both sums.

$$
S=\sum^n_{i=1} {f(x_i^*)\delta x_i}
$$

This can be expressed as an integral

$$
S=\int^n_{i=1}{f(x)dx}
$$

{% hint style="info" %}
n is the number of subintervals for the curve to be divided into.
{% endhint %}

### Applications

The area under a velocity - time graph is displacement (dx)&#x20;

$$
v*t=\delta x
$$

By finding the area under a velocity - time graph's curve you get displacement of that time period. This can be used in other graphs as well; just be sure to adjust the measurement accordingly. The applied logic aboves for finding what the area under a graph gives you applies to virtually all graphs.
