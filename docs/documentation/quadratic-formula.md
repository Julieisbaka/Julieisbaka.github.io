# Quadratic formula

{% hint style="warning" %}
The quadratic formula is cited as a [deep theorem](deep-theorem.md)
{% endhint %}

$$
x=\frac{\left(-b\pm\ \sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}\right)}{2a}
$$

Where a is the coefficient of x^2 term, b is the coefficient of the x term, and c is the coefficient of the x^0 term or the constant term. The quadratic formula is a useful tool but should not be relied upon.
