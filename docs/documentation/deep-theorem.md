# Deep theorem

Qualitatively, a deep theorem is a theorem whose proof is long, complicated, difficult, or appears to involve branches of mathematics which are not obviously related to the theorem itself (Shanks 1993). Shanks (1993) cites the [quadratic reciprocity theorem](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/QuadraticReciprocityTheorem.html) as an example of a deep theorem.
