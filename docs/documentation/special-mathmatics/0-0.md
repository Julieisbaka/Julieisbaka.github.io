# 0^0

Conventionally it is said that any number raised to the power of 0 is equal to one.&#x20;

Proof / rational:

$$
2^2=2*2
$$

$$
2^3=2*2*2
$$

This can be rewritten as

$$
2^3=2^2*2
$$

$$
2^2=\frac{2^3}{2}
$$

Thus the difference between exponents of x decrease by a factor of x as the exponent decreases by 1.

This means that we can find the value of 2 squared by dividing 2 cubed by 2. 8 / 2 = 4. Therefore 2 to the first power is 4/2, which is 2. and furthermore that means 2 to the power of zero is 2/2, which is one. Thus 2 to the power of 0 is equal to one.

If you make this same process with 0, then we get 0 to the power of 0 is equal to 0 divided by 0 which is inderterminiate.
