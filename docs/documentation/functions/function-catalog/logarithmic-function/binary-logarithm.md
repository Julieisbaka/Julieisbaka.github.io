# Binary logarithm

The binary logarithm is equivalent to log base 2 and is the [common logarithm](common-logarithm.md) within [computer science.](../../../applications/computer-science/)

The binary or base 2 logarithm is the lowest logarithmic base that maintains information of its numbers. Eg: A logarithm with a base of one would not show any information about the input value as 1 to the infinity still equals 1.

The logarithm of base 2 is called the the binary log due to how computers fundamentally store information as electrons (or lack thereof).
