# Base 10

## What is so important about base ten?

The base we use in everyday life and counting; it acts as the common log for mot scientific, mathematics, and everyday things. The system of counting in which we used is base 10; it is what we use on a daily basis.&#x20;

### Why do we use base ten?

Generally the explanation for the evolution of this dominant number system in humans can be contributed to the fact the we have 10 fingers. having ten fingers makes a counting system base of 10 a very simple, logical, and easy thing to do relatively to other potential bases.

#### Why is it not better to use binary?

You may know that technically only way to process data is through binary or base 2 logarithmic base. The only real way to store data on a subatomic scale is the existence or non existence of an electron within the measured space. If an electron exists then their is an electric charge; if it doesn't exist then their isnt a charge. Using this knowldge you my think that the processing and thinking of numbers binarylicly would be more efficient for our brains to process as it would pr4event the need from converting bases; however if you have ever seen binary you may know that a single 0 or 1 is not enoiugh to hold the information of a single number or letter. You would need dozens of binary characters to hold small amounts of information, and this does is not made up by the faster conversion process.
