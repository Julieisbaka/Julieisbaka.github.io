# logarithmic function

A logarithm is a type of mathematical operation that is inverse to that of exponentiation.

* [Natural logarithm](natural-logarithm..md)
* [Common logarithm](common-logarithm.md)
* [Binary logarithm](binary-logarithm.md)
* [Denary logarithm](base-10.md)

When we are given the [base 2](#user-content-fn-1)[^1], for example, and exponent 3, then we can evaluate 2^3.

$$
2^3 = 8
$$

Inversely, if we are given the base 2 and its power 8 --

$$
2^x = 8
$$

\-- then what is the exponent that will produce 8?

That exponent is called a logarithm.  We call the exponent 3 the logarithm of 8 with base 2.

$$
\log_28=3
$$

We write the base, 2 in this case, as a subscript.

3 is the exponent to which 2 must be raised to produce 8.

[^1]: Binary logarithm; the smallest possible real, base 10 - based, logarithm.
