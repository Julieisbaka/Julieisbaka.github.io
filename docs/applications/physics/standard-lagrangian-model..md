# Standard Lagrangian model.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The standard model is extremely complex and intricate. Most likely previous study in particle physics and multivariable calculus will be needed. I can not do this formula justice; it is perhaps the most important formula ever made.

The formula is perhaps the most important and influential of physics. The formula describes the fundamental motion of particles and the interactions between forces. The formula is perhaps considered one of the most important physical discoveries of mankind.&#x20;

<summary>Bosons</summary>

Bosons are force-carrying particles, and there are four species of bosons that interact with other particles using three fundamental forces. Photons carry electromagnetism, gluons carry the strong force and W and Z bosons carry the weak force. The most recently discovered boson, the Higgs boson, is a bit different.

The formula is a quantum field theory which means that its fundamental objects are in quantum fields.&#x20;
