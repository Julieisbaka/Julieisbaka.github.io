# Rayleigh-Jeans law

#### Rayleigh-Jeans Law

The Rayleigh-Jeans Law is a classical approximation that provides an expression for the spectral energy distribution of electromagnetic radiation emitted by a blackbody in thermal equilibrium. This law holds true primarily in the long-wavelength (or low-frequency) limit. It can be derived from classical physics and is expressed mathematically by the equation:

\[ I(\nu, T) = \frac{8\pi \nu^2 kT}{c^3} ]

Where:

* ( I(\nu, T) ) represents the energy density per unit frequency,
* ( \nu ) is the frequency of the radiation,
* ( T ) denotes the absolute temperature of the blackbody,
* ( k ) is the Boltzmann constant, approximately ( 1.38 \times 10^{-23} , \text{J/K} ),
* ( c ) is the speed of light in vacuum, approximately ( 3.00 \times 10^8 , \text{m/s} ).

#### Applicability and Limitations

The Rayleigh-Jeans Law is a good approximation at lower frequencies or longer wavelengths. However, it dramatically fails at higher frequencies, where it inaccurately predicts that the energy density increases infinitelyâ€”a phenomenon historically known as the "ultraviolet catastrophe." Experimentally, this is not observed, as the energy density tends to fall off with increasing frequency.

#### Historical Importance

The inaccuracies of the Rayleigh-Jeans Law at higher frequencies played a crucial role in the development of quantum mechanics. The failure to align with experimental data pushed physicists to seek explanations beyond classical theories.

#### The Path to Quantum Mechanics

In 1900, Max Planck introduced a radical new concept to solve the ultraviolet catastrophe: quantization of energy. By proposing that energy is not continuous but rather emitted or absorbed in discrete amounts called "quanta," Planck derived an empirical law that correctly described the spectral distribution across all frequencies. This is known as Planck's Law, which not only corrected the issues presented by the Rayleigh-Jeans Law but also laid foundational principles for quantum theory.

#### Conclusion

While the Rayleigh-Jeans Law effectively describes blackbody radiation at low frequencies, its limitations at high frequencies underscore the profound shift from classical to quantum physics. The resolution of these limitations through Planck's Law marked the beginning of quantum mechanics, fundamentally transforming our understanding of physical phenomena at microscopic scales.
