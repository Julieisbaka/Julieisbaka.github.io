# Common logarithm

The common logarithm is denoted by a log without the existence of a base and indicates that the base used in the log is the same as the base system used to defined the numerical values in the same system. Generally the common log is equivalent to

$$
\log_{10}x=\log{x}
$$

Due to the common base system in math being base 10.

The common log however is not defined as log base 10 of x; the common log while almost always is log base 10, is not defined as that.

### [Log Base 2](binary-logarithm.md) (binary) as a common log

In computing the only real way to store and measure data is the existance (or lack their of) of an electron. If an electron exists a one will be outputed (boolean value of true), and if a electron does not exist then a 0 will be outputed (boolean value of false). This means that the system of data used in computing is base 2, the lowest possible base. The common logarithm in this scenario would be a log with base 2 not base 10.&#x20;

Binary can be represented in base 10 by using the change of base formula, or by counting the exponents of two.
