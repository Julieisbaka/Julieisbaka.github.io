# Functions

This is a special page due to how important functions are to mathematics. This page is not designed to introduce someone to functions, instead it is designed to understand what function actually are and how to use them. This is essential the the understanding of the majority of docs on this wiki.

A function is represented by the form f(x). The value inside of the function is the value of the independent variable. The independent variable is always graphed on the x axis (this is why the general form of a function has the input value as x). The dependent variable is always graphed on the y axis. Because the dependent variable is the output or measured variable is on the y axis; we say that f (function, you don't need to use the letter f) = y. The figure f(x) is the the function of a x value. What is the y value at a certain x value?

{% code fullWidth="true" %}
```mathml
let f(1) = 0
The interpretation of this is "The y value of the function at x = 1 is 0"
but then let f(1) = 1
If we assume both of these to be true the the interpretation is 
"The y value of the function at x = 1 is both 0 and 1"
```
{% endcode %}

This can't be true: pretend a formula is used to solve the sum of an addition equation, if the same input is given twice with different outputs for each that logically does not work.

$$
x+x \equiv 2x, always.
$$

{% hint style="info" %}
The notation of f(x) with a superscript of a minus sign or negative one is generally used to notate the [inverse of a function.](function-catalog/inverse-functions.md)
{% endhint %}

Let the function f(x) = y (as it is in the standard form)

Then the inverse of the function f(x) = y is f(y) = x.

$$
f^- = x, f=y
$$

The inverse can be found by swapping the x and y variables and then solving for y in terms of x.

$$
f\prime = \delta f(x),f\prime=\frac{d}{dx}f(x)
$$

The above notation is a notation for [derivatives.](broken-reference) The first derivative of a function (and second of the input variable) is equal to the secant line (slope). The first derivative of x is the measurement of the rate of change of the function, represented by d/dx, and is found by finding the equation of the tangent line (the line tangent to the function). The most primal examples of derivatives are distance and motion.
