Otherwise please continue reading for more math and excitement.

This section and its following pages contain information. documentation, and etc that does not fit into a sure one category but is still none the less very important and very mathy. These pages are more loosely maintained and are thus also a good place to learn how to make wiki pages and to try out and to experiment with wiki editing and math collaboration. This section includes things like extra details and more, so only precede if you truly like math.
