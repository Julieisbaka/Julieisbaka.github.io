## Calculating with gravity

The gravitational constant on earth is -9.8m/s^2 This means that for every second your velocity will increase by 9.8 m/s in the downwards direction or by -9.8 in the upwards direction. Thus due to newtons second law of motion we can describe the force of gravity exerted on an object would be equal to the mass of said object multiplied by the gravitational acceleration (which is 9.8m/s^2 on earth).
