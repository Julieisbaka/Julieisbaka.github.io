# Biology

Math can be used to model, via regressions and the similar, estimations. In this topic you will learn how to use math to model things. There are many applications of math within biology. Population growth, doubling times, population decay, pollution levels, ocean levels, pi charts, graphs for independent and dependent variables, and more / etc. If this sounds interesting to you then please move on to the next page and continue reading to get started learning about this topic that you find so interesting.

Or get a bit of an introduction to the content on this page before moving on!

### Useful formulas and information for the following pages

Prokaryotes, due to them being single celled organisms, reproduce through asexual reproduction through a process known as binary fission. So one cell would split into 2 both cells being almost identical to each other. Because of this the mathematical modeling of prokaryotic population growth is very ... very non chaotic. Prokaryotic cells reproduce in something known as a doubling time, After every doubling time the population of bacteria will be doubled. This means the population of bacteria can be very easily modeled by exponential functions, this makes it great as an introduction to the usages of mathematics in biology. The function would be as follows where t represents time.

$$
P(t) =P_i^{2/t}where\:t\:is\:\N
$$
