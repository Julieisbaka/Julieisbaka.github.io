# Chemistry

## Special numbers

Their are some special numbers in chemistry they you may want to know.

Avogadro's number - Has a value of 6.022 \* 10^(23), it is the measurement of the amount of atoms within a mole of an element. A mole of an element is the amount such that the weight of the mole is equal to the average atomic mass in grams of the element. It can be found by measuring the amount of hydrogen ions (h+) are needed to read 1 gram on a scale.

To convert from the atoms to moles you just divide your given amount by Avogadro's number. and you do the opposite to go back of course.
