# Physics

## Concepts

The most fundamental examples of derivatives are distance and motion.

## Theorems

### Newtons law of cooling

“The rate of heat loss from a body is directly proportional to the difference in temperature between the body and its surroundings, given that the temperature difference is not large.”

Newtons law of cooling can be used to model the rate of cooling or heating of an object. It measures the temperature of a system over time. And is given by the equation

$$
T(t)=
$$

Where T(t) is the time dependent reaction for temperature, T is temperature, t is time, k is rate of cooling, and is

The formula can be represented as the following differential equation

$$
f(x) = x * e^{2 pi i \xi x}
$$
