# Non math related

Most embedded graphs on this website use desmos as the graphing engine as it allows for free forever complex algebraic graphing.

The majority of graphing based activities on this website are done through GEOgebra, a CAS; a darn good one in fact.

Diagrams and charts on this website are mostly done through the mermaid syntax language and platform.
