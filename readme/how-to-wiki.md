# How to wiki?

```markdown
This wiki is primarily composed in markdown. To keep with this style and to stay compatible
with Gitbook I highly recommend writing documentation in markdown or markdown adjacent languages.
The list of languages that you should limit use is as follows:

```

* HTML
* JS
* JSON
* Markdown
* iPYnb
* M HTML
* CSS
* JSS
* mathimatica
* Magma
* Matlab
* Python
* Plain text
* Latex
* Katex
* Tex
* Batex
* Python
* Mermaid
* Git
* Bash
* text
* Symbolab script
* Gss
* Maple
* Coq js
* Coq
* MathML
* Some others but use common sense.

When creating and editing pages and documentation their are a few things you need to consider first, most importantly, assume good will; most likely someone is not trying to mess something up, if someone makes a mistake you can fix it or let the original editor know of the problem with their documentation on the wiki.
