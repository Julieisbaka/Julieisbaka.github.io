# How to wiki?

```markdown
This wiki is primarly composed in markdown. To keep with this style and to stay compatiable
with gitbook I highly recomend writing documentation in markdown or markdown adjacent languages.
The list of languages that you should limit use is as follows:

```

* HTML
* JS
* JSON
* Markdown
* Ipynb
* MHTML
* CSS
* JSS
* Desmos script
* mathimatoca
* Magma
* Matlab
* Python
* Plain text
* Latex
* Katex
* Tex
* Batex
* Python
* Mermaid
* Git
* Bash
* text
* Symbolab script
* Gss
* Maple
* Coqjs
* Coq
* Mathml
* Some others but use common sense.
