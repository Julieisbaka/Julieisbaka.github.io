# Wiki how?

```markdown
This wiki is primarily composed in markdown. To keep with this style and to stay compatible
with Gitbook I highly recommend writing documentation in markdown or markdown adjacent languages.
The list of languages that you should limit use is as follows:

```

* Markdown + math based variants
* Tex + popular and math based variants
* Mermaid + adoptions
* HTML + variants
* JSON for configs
* JS for configs
* YML for configs
* Git files for Git

When creating and editing pages and documentation their are a few things you need to consider first, most importantly, assume good will; most likely someone is not trying to mess something up, if someone makes a mistake you can fix it or let the original editor know of the problem with their documentation on the wiki.

### Standerization

* Markdown lint vscode extension for linting. Ignore no embedded HTML.
