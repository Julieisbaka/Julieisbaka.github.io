**12 / 22 / 2024:**

All embedded links and content within pages will be temporarily down. This issue will not be fixed until I am back from vacation as it is an issue with the book.json file which I can not access right now. I can however approve pull requests, so if anyone wants to fix it then go ahead. Otherwise you can expect this to be about 2 weeks; though I will try to fix it while on vacation I just don't have my computer so its a little tricky.
