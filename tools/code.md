# Code

**CAS Systems & Math Coding:**\
Computer Algebra Systems (CAS) are software tools designed to facilitate symbolic mathematics operations. They provide capabilities such as algebraic manipulation, equation solving, and function plotting. Math coding, on the other hand, involves using programming languages or scripts for mathematical computations, enabling customization and automation of tasks in fields like engineering and data analysis.
