# Sigma function

The Sigma function is the function of Summnation. Summnation is the iteratble addition of something.&#x20;

$$
\sum^n_kf(x)=2k+x^2
$$

This is an example of a Sigma function. The function can be interpreted as follow: The variable above the Sigma, n, is the upper bounds of the iteration; once the iterate variable, k, reaches the upper boundary the iteration stops.
