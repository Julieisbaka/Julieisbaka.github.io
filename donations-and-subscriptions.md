# Donations and subscriptions

I am well aware of current issues the wiki is facing; the ability to not be able to edit pages really being a sore point for a wiki, I would like to improve this website but in order to do that I need support from people like you. You can donate as little or as much as you want, or if you want some perks you can consider a subscription to Mathwiki premium. I want to improve this wiki, make sure it contains all the information you need and more. I am currently considering buying a custom domain name; however its expensive and without support I can not afford to make that big of a purchase without financial support as well as support in handling and managing this wiki. I do my best to keep this wiki ad free for all users, the premium service does not take perks away from free users.
