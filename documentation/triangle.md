# Triangle

## Formulas and their proofs

The area of a square is s\*s. A square can be split in half into 2 right triangles. This means the area of a triangle is half that then a rectangle or square of the dimensions. Thus the formula for the area of a triangle is

$$
\frac{1}{2}hl
$$

h is the height and l is the length.

### Angles

We know that, by definition, a straight line is 180 degrees.

Halve of that would be the shape formed by the angle known as a right angle. An angle with a 90 degree measurement. Let's create a right triangle.
