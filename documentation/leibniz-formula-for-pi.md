# Leibniz formula for pi

$$
{\displaystyle \sum _{k=0}^{\infty }{\frac {(-1)^{k}}{2k+1}}}=\frac{\pi}{4}
$$

{% hint style="info" %}
Curiously, despite being named Leibniz's formula for pi, this formula was not actually created by Leibniz. Bernoulli who was Leibniz's teacher and mentor discovered it; the book was then worked on and published by both of them. Leibniz had a curious arrangement with his teacher in which he bought all mathematical discoveries made by his teacher.
