# Derivatives

If you want an introduction to anti-derivatives then skip to here: [Anti-derivatives](derivatives.md)

Otherwise continue from here.

To put it simply a derivative is rate of change. As we know the formula for slope is change in y divided by change in x.

$$
m=\frac{\delta{y}}{\delta{x}}
$$

m is slope, Delta y is change in y, Delta x is change in x. The Delta symbol can be changed to the letter D

$$
m=\frac{Dy}{Dx}
$$

Thus this is identical to slope. The second derivative of x is also Dy/Dx and thus the second derivative of x is slope.
