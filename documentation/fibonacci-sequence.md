# Fibonacci sequence

The Fibonacci sequence is the list of numbers such that a number in the sequence is the sum of the of the two sequence numbers.

$$
f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)
$$

for the starting number equal to 0 or 1 (Be consistant)

## **Applications**

Johannes Kepler observed that the ratio of consecutive Fibonacci numbers converges. "as 5 is to 8 so is 8 to 13, practically, and as 8 is to 13, so is 13 to 21 \[almost.]", and concluded that these ratios approach the golden ratio Ï†
