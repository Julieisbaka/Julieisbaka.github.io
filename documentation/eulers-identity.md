  Euler's identity is an identity made by Euler using e, Euler's number. It
  relates fundamental concepts in math together in a clean and logical way.

# Euler's identity

$$
e^{i\pi}+1=0
$$

$$
e^{i\pi}+1-1=0-1,\:Thus\:e^{i\pi}=-1
$$

The beauty of this formula is what it actually does. It connects e; the base of the natural [log](functions/function-catalog/logarithmic-function/), i; the imaginary 1D basis vector unit, 1; the multiplicative constant, and 0; the addictive constant. Euler's identity can be expanded to the following:

$$
\left(1+\frac{1}{n}\right)^{\left(n\cdot\sqrt{-1}\cdot 4(\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{\left(-1\right)^{k}}{2k+1})\right)}
$$

If you are just looking for math direcly please skip this sideanrt i dont want to take away or distract from your learning through the Math Wiki; otherwise keep reading... or dont. I made the the above formula just to see how much I could expand it; there is no real reason to do so. (1+1/n)^n as n approaches infinity is equal to e. The square root of -1 is defined as i. The last part is Leibniz's formula for pi, and because the formula is for pi/4 I multiplied that by 4 to just get pi.
