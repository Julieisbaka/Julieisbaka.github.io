# Iteration functions

Iteration functions are functions that are based on an iterator. It's a repetitive task, generally most iteration functions use an iterator variable that will increment up in a certain way, each time being plugged into something. Then something (based on the function) is done with those computed values.

The most basic iteration functions is the Sigma function; summation. An example of an iteration functions (specifically summation) follows:

$$
f(x)=\sum_{{k=0}^*}^n(x*k)
$$

{% hint style="info" %}
k and n can be an almost any variable or number; n and k are commonly used as the variables to represent the bounds of iteration functions, and commonly k is set equal to 0, but both can be value in the domain of the bounds.
{% endhint %}

The variable k is the iterator variable and represents the lower bounds of the function; k will iterate until it reaches the upper bounds of the function. The equation following the Iteration symbol (in this case sigma as it is the symbol for this type of iteration) is the equation you plug the iterator into on each interval of iteration until n.
